				Hopefully a useful tool for tracking and substantiating my understanding of computer science, that which
				I have chosen as my craft and my method for providing use to other human beings and society. In brief,
				hopeful assistance for my conduit for contribution.

				<div class="codingtwo">
				I require a method for viewing my work in a browser. What can I use? It appears I've come by a method. 
				I've purchased a raspberry pi and downloaded apache onto it, thereby endowing it with the capacity to 
				serve web pages. Presently all appears to be functioing as I had hoped, though only after a fair bit of 
				tinkering and crushingly silly mistakes on my part; mistakes of such a flavor that I've numerous times
				felt compelled to question my intelligence. But a construct of my own! HUZZAH! To have a thing, a project, 
				that is MINE! Perhaps this is a selfish impulse I'm indulging, perhaps I should be wary, but I think for 
				now I'll forge ahead, drinking in the new knowledge born of my inevitable, and seemingly incessant failures.
				A thing to shape, to perfect, whose details I might fret over, whose potential may prove boundless, what a
				pleasant concept.
