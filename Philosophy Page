			<h1>Philosophy</h1>
				
				Presently the exploration of Nietzche and Stoicism, but subject to change and expatiation. My present 
				philosophical view is one I've dubbed Stoic-Nietchiesm, though I'm unlikely the first to have cultivated 
				such a perspective. I've organized it's title in it's present order deliberately. While I do not subscribe 
				to a world-view of pure stoicism, certain stoic principles form the predicate of my ideology with certain
				Nietzchiean principles assmembled thereupon to form a structure that seems to suit me.
